```

Available arguments. All of these are optional and listed here with their default values.

```yaml

  with:
    # The minimum percentage of coverage each source file
    # should met for the action to be successful.
    coverage: 80

    # Display all sources files. 
    # By default this action only reports the files that fail 
    # to met the minimum coverage.
    show-all-files: false        

    # The Swift build directory.
    # This should match the Swift compilers --scratch-path argument.
    # This folder is searched for the JSON code 
    # coverage files. All other files are ignored.
    build-dir: .build

    # Glob used within the build-dir to locate the 
    # code coverage JSON files.
    coverage-files: **/codecov/*.json
        
    # Comma list of globs which define the source
    # files we want coverage for. 
    # Generally these should match the folders where
    # the sources for your project reside.
    includes: **/Sources/**
        
    # Comma list of globs which define source
    # files we want to exclude from coverage reporting. 
    # When filtering the files to report on, 
    # includes are processed first, then excludes.
